\dictdef[prefix=Molecular, caption=\textbf{Bio}-Informatics]{Bioinformatics}{OED}
{Bioinformatics is conceptualising biology in terms of molecules (in the sense of physical chemistry) and applying \enquote{\dictemph{informatics techniques}} (derived from disciplines such as applied maths, computer science and statistics) to \dictemph{understand} and \dictemph{organise} the \dictemph{information} associated with these molecules, on a \dictemph{large scale}. In short, bioinformatics is a management information system for molecular biology and has many \dictemph{partial applications}.}
